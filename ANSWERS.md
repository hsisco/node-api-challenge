Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
- Express is a light, unopinionated framework that sits on top of Node.js, allowing us to map incoming requests to the appropriate request handler based on the URL and HTTP Method used via Routing.

Describe Middleware?
- It adds extra functionality to the features available in Express by using small functions that handle a single aspect of the application.

Describe a Resource?
- The intended conceptual target of a hypertext reference. A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds to the mapping.

What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
- The HTTP status code reflects the outcome of the request with a status code and, potentially, a message defining the success or failure.

How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
- Express Routers create a more modular application that is easier to maintain and pass state through.
